# AIBOM Workshop at SBOM-a-Rama (Fall 2024)

Building on the success of our initial [AIBOM workshop at RSAC 2024](https://github.com/aibom-squad/rsa-2024), we are continuing our efforts at the [CISA SBOM-a-Rama](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/events/sbom-rama-fall-2024) this fall. Since our last meeting, we have made significant progress, including the development and formalization of key AIBOM use cases. This workshop provides a collaborative platform to brainstorm and define the next steps in advancing AIBOM, ensuring we remain at the forefront of AI software supply chain security. Your insights and contributions will be invaluable as we work together to shape the future of AIBOM.

## Agenda

1. **Introduction**: Overview of [AIBOM TT workstream](https://github.com/aibom-squad/AIBOM-Tiger-Team) and its use cases (10 minutes)
2. **Insight itno AIBOM Research**: Technical specifications, prioritization, and model card reference (20 minutes)
3. **Workshop Discussion**: The goal is to define next steps for the AIBOM workstream after completing the writing of use cases. (remaining time)
   - **Technical Specifications**: Exploring the relationship between defined use cases and AIBOM fields. Participants will discuss next steps for field mapping to use cases and consider how we can contribute to evolving standards, such as SPDX and CDX.
   - **Lifecycle Considerations**: Addressing when and how often AIBOM should be generated (out of scope: generation tool for AIBOM). This discussion aims to identify next steps for AIBOM TT workstream to explore how AIBOM can be seamlessly integrated into existing workflows and lifecycle management processes.
