# AIBOM Workshop at SBOM-a-Rama (Fall 2024)

Building on the success of our initial AIBOM workshop at RSAC 2024, we are continuing our efforts at the [CISA SBOM-a-Rama](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/events/sbom-rama-fall-2024) this fall. Since our last meeting, we have made significant progress, including the development and formalization of key AIBOM use cases. This workshop provides a collaborative platform to brainstorm and define the next steps in advancing AIBOM, ensuring we remain at the forefront of AI software supply chain security. Your insights and contributions will be invaluable as we work together to shape the future of AIBOM.

**Thanks to our sponsors:** Lockheed Martin, TBD
