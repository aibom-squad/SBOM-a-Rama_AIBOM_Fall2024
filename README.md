# AIBOM Workshop at SBOM-a-Rama (Fall 2024)

Building on the success of our initial [AIBOM workshop at RSAC 2024](https://github.com/aibom-squad/rsa-2024), we are continued our efforts at the [CISA SBOM-a-Rama](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/events/sbom-rama-fall-2024) this fall. Since May 2024, we have made significant progress, including the development and formalization of key AIBOM use cases. This workshop, in September 2024, provides a collaborative platform to brainstorm and define the next steps in advancing AIBOM, ensuring we remain at the forefront of AI software supply chain security. Your insights and contributions will be invaluable as we work together to shape the future of AIBOM.

## Summary

The primary consensus from the community was that the next steps after creating the AIBOM Use Cases should be:
- Developing the AIBOM Minimum Viable Product (MVP): defining the essential fields required for AIBOM, including establishing a feedback loop with SPDX and CycloneDX (CDX)
- Conducting AIBOM Field Mapping for the Highest Priority Use Case - Compliance: using an example scenario based on SB 1047 to map out the necessary fields for compliance purposes

## Next Steps
- Continue with AIBOM Use Cases documentation as per on-going efforts: [https://github.com/aibom-squad/AIBOM-Tiger-Team](https://github.com/aibom-squad/AIBOM-Tiger-Team)
   - AIBOM TT WG meeting minutes: [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IpXG7XBOJnPl_hwFf3JZkDaFb0k2CnI0/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110194678381965933391&rtpof=true&sd=true)
- Invite guest speakers to some of the AIBOM TT WG bi-weekly meetings to share insights on regulatory applicability to AIBOM (e.g., SB 1047)
- Start of the AIBOM fields mapping - TBD.
